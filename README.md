Blocker
===

Blocker is a Google Chrome extension that blocks access to certain pre-defined websites and allows you to finally get some work done. Once you've made a list of sites to block, just click the lock icon in the toolbar and get to work. To unlock, you have to enter a randomly generated 15 character case-sensitive alpha-numeric key.
